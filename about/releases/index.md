This plan is a guide for how the project plans to schedule upcoming releases, taking
into account the release schedule of the underlying Node.js runtime.

![](release-plan.png)


The active Node-RED stream (3.x) will get a new minor version release (for example, 3.1 ->  3.2)
every three months. Maintenance releases (for example 3.1.0 -> 3.1.1) will continue
to happen as and when they are needed.

At the end of April 2023, when Node 14.x reaches its end-of-life, we will publish
Node-RED 4.x that will *drop* support for Node 14.

The 3.x stream will then enter maintenance mode. It will only receive bug fixes
and security updates. New features could get back-ported from 4.x if there was
a very good reason to do so as well as people available to do the work.

The 4.x stream will continue in active development with a minor release every
three months or so for a year, when the next major release is made.

This proposal means:

 - We have a regular cycle of releases - getting new features into the hands of users.
 - We have a schedule to help us prioritise and plan backlog items.
 - We can provide longer-term stable releases with a well-known end of life.
 - We have a plan that enables us to make potentially breaking changes once a year.
